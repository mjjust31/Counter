# Counter
Javascript practice: 


When I load the page, I see a counter with the following main parts: 
1. Counter Title
2. Counter Number
   a. Create an id or class to grab the counter element. This is what changes on the page. 
   b. When the number is negative, the color of the counter turns red. 
   c. When the number is 0, the color of the coutner is black. 
   d. When the count is positive, the color of the counter is green. 
3. Three buttons that control the counter number
   a. decrease button:
   i. When I click the decrease button, the counter goes down by one.
   b. Reset button: 
   i. When I click this button, the counter starts at 0.
   c. When I click the incrase button, the counter goes up by one. 

Three functions: decrease the counter, reset the counter, increase the counter. 
Fourth function will be used for the stying element on the counter.
